    "I'll be given access to every student's maths and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend\n",
    "\n",
    "1)\tOut of the 15 schools the independent schools have greater Average scores than Government schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)\tOut of 39,170 students in the 15 schools only the overall passing rate is 72.808272%\n",
    "\n",
    "3)\tIndependent schools dominated the top 5 schools in overall passing rate and Government schools dominated the bottom 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) The percentage of passing maths is higher than the percentage of passing reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Schools with higher spending averages, has lower overall passing rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Draw two conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "1)\tThe analysis shows the independent schools dominated in the top 5 schools in overall passing rate and Government schools dominated the bottom 5. This strongest difference is produced due to the average of mathematics and reading score, so further analysis remains essential to carried out about the independent school’s method and discover if any of these methods could be applied to Government schools as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)\t The analysis is based on the passing rate of maths and reading score, this is not useful metric, even though standardized scores are important part of academic achievement, however, still teachers assign marks based on project and assignments to get more holistic understanding of school performance. More subjects could also be included in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3)\tThe analysis shows the larger school spending & Larger school size doesn’t represent effectiveness. The analysis shows the lower spending ranges (per student: $585-$605, <$585) and size (1000-2000, <1000) produce best results. So instead of spending huge amount the important aspect under considerable category is building a small and medium size schools.\n",
